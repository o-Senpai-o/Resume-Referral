## Hard Skills

### Summary and Architecture

- Achieved \<X>% test coverage by writing high-quality code using \<ARCHITECTURE NAME> with \<TECHNOLOGY NAME> and covering code with \<TEST TYPES>.

> Achieved 90% test coverage by writing code using MVVM architecture with RX and covering code with unit tests and UI automation tests.

- Improved \<testability / scalability / stability> of the \<app / system> by \<X>% by replacing \<LEGACY ARCHITECTURE NAME> with \<NEW ARCHITECTURE NAME>.
> Improved testability of the app by 50% by replacing MVC architecture with MVVM.

> Improved app's crash free rate from 80% to 99.8% by writing 4,000 unit tests that helped to identify 30 defects and fix them.

- Developed \<ARCHITECTURE NAME>, \<ARCHITECTURE EXPLANATION>. That allowed to \<LIST OF BENEFITS>.
> Developed backend driven UI architecture, where screens and interactions are defined by JSON. That allowed to instantly push updates to users without them having to update the app. Think of it as a mobile browser engine.


### Technical skills and achievements

- Enhanced \<app's / system's> core feature by \<X>% by \<integrating / implementing / developing> \<TECHNOLOGY NAME>.
> Enhanced app's core feature by 30% by integrating Machine Learning text recognition solution (ML OCR) into the app.

- Saved \<X> developer hours by \<ACTION NAME>.
> Saved 150 developer hours by documenting guideline to create common UI components, that speed up development by 50%.

- Reduced \<app's / system's> \<battery / memory / network> consumption by \<X>% \<ACTION NAME>.
> Reduced app's battery consumption by 30% by improving data synchronization mechanism, which allowed to synchronize large data only on Wi-Fi network and while connected to the power source.

> Reduced app's size from 100Mb down to 67Mb by removing unnecessary dependencies and using native libraries whenever possible.

- Speed up \<app's / system's / site's> \<start up / load> time by \<X>% by \<ACTION NAME>.
> Speed up app's startup time by 70% by improving caching mechanism.

> Speed up page load time by 70% by pre-loading most popular content for the user.

> Speed up project's clean build and iterative build times by 400% by using Bazel build system instead of Xcode, which allowed better caching.

> Speed up provisioning profile distribution process from 7 minutes to 1 minute by creating shell scripts to encrypt, decrypt, install provisioning profiles.

- \<NUMERIC RESULT>. Achieved by \<migrating / converting> \<codebase / database / service / cloud> from \<OLD STUFF> to \<NEW STUFF>.
> Reduced legacy code by 25% by migrating old codebase from Objective-C to Swift. Brought down from 60,000 lines of code to 45,000.

> Reduced XIB and Storyboard UI files from 26 to 12 by converting them to Swift using UIKit.

- Implemented new features: \<LIST OF FEATURES> using \<LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES>.
> Implemented new features: user forms with input validation (100% programmatic UI), custom UI components, file upload, and data exchange with backend using REST.

> Implemented 100% programmatic UI in Swift using UIKit.

- A11Y: improved accessibility of \<X> screens by
implementing accessibility for \<COMPONENT YOU MADE ACCESSIBLE>.
> A11Y: improved accessibility of 5 screens by implementing accessibility navigation for complex UI elements. Ex.: interactive chart.


### SDE Processes

- Reviewed \<X> pull requests daily using \<CODE REVIEW GUIDELINE NAME>.
> Reviewed 2–5 pull requests daily using Google’s code review best practices.

- Co-authored code standards for \<TEAM NAME> of \<X> people.
> Co-authored code standards for iOS team of 10 people.

- Interviewed \<X> candidates for \<TECHNOLOGY NAME> position.
> Interviewed 10 candidates for iOS engineer position.

> Worked with a cross-functional team of 50 people: mobile and backend engineers, designers, QA, data analytics.


### Mentorship

- Mentored \<X> junior engineers.
> Mentored 2 Junior Engineers (L3) and helped them grow to Middle Engineers (L4) in 11 months.

- Trained \<X> people to \<LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES>.
> Trained over 500 children aged between 9-16 to computer programming, game development, basics of algorithms, and data structures using Scratch, Minecraft, and C++.
